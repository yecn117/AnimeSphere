# [Goals achieved and missed]
**Group Goals:**

**Personal (Student Perspective):**

We are interested in further expanding our theoretical knowledge in web programming by developing a web chat application using the new technologies Python and Flask. This is intended to particularly strengthen our practical programming skills. Both of us felt that we genuinely learned through the course and the project work. It was often challenging, and there were times when we were unsure how to proceed, but ultimately, we overcame these challenges and delivered a respectable project.

Additionally, it was our goal to enhance our documentation skills. We are both aware that thorough documentation is not only crucial during our studies but also holds significant importance in many professions later on. We put a lot of effort into the documentation, striving to work in a detailed manner in each section. Unfortunately, we realized that we started a bit too late, resulting in many late nights spent completing the documentation. For the next time, we would place a greater emphasis on documentation and start earlier. We cannot currently provide a final assessment of how well our documentation turned out.


**Luka´s Goal:** 

Personally, I hope to learn more about Python and HTML from this project and the course. I am aware, from a friend already working in the industry, that these two languages are frequently used, making a good understanding of both advantageous.

**Yakub´s Goal:**

I hope to become more proficient in programming web apps after completing the project, as I likely plan to pursue this direction in the future.


**As the Manufacturer and CEO of AnimeSphere:**

**User Growth:** A primary objective would be the continuous expansion of the user base. The goal is to make the app a central hub for anime fans by consistently attracting new members and promoting active participation. Users should prefer AnimeSphere over other communication options and recommend it to their friends as a platform for exchanging ideas.

**Technological Innovation:** The CEO could strive to continuously enhance the app and introduce technological innovations to optimize the user experience. This could include the integration of AI for personalized recommendations, improvements in the user interface, or the introduction of new communication features. Currently, AnimeSphere is only a web application, but in the future, it could evolve into a mobile app for Android and iOS.

**Monetization:** Creating a sustainable business model could be a goal. This could be achieved through the introduction of premium memberships, advertising partnerships, merchandising, or other monetization strategies to ensure the long-term financial stability of the platform. Monetization realistically becomes a pursuit once a sufficiently large user base is established.

**Partnerships and Collaboration:** Forming partnerships with anime production studios, organizers of anime events, or other relevant players in the anime industry could be an objective. Such collaborations could help establish the app as a significant player in the anime community.

**Goals for the Project:**
Our primary ambition for the project from the start was a working and functioning login/register system, a chatroom creation feature, and the ability to chat in a chatroom. These were the essential elements we knew had to be functional in the project. We believe we succeeded in achieving all of these goals.

In addition to these primary objectives, there were smaller tasks we aimed to accomplish, such as improving the overall design of the website. We intended to include a contact page where users could send messages to the owners. While the messages are saved in the database, we encountered challenges in making them clearly visible on the website. Another addition was a simple "All About Us" page. During the project, we realized the importance of enabling users to search for specific chatrooms, leading us to incorporate a search bar.

Inside the chatrooms, we aimed to have messages display the user's name and be timestamped. Fortunately, we successfully implemented this feature, although we faced some challenges with chatrooms in general. The plan to add user roles, allowing someone to act as a moderator and ban users for inappropriate behavior, was not realized (see more in the improvements section).

Responsive design was another aspect that concerned us, both in the chatrooms and throughout the entire web application. While we made some progress in certain aspects of responsive design, particularly in the ..., it is not flawless (details in the improvements section).

Despite the unachieved aspects, we feel that overall, we have created a project of which we can be proud and confident.
