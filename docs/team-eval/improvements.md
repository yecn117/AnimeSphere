# [How we would improve next time]

**Organization:**
The first aspect we need to improve is our overall organization. While we started early, maintained a consistent work pace, and collaborated effectively (except during exam periods when our productivity dipped), we had a tendency to postpone important tasks. This habit resulted in us only addressing critical matters when under pressure, leading to occasional oversights in certain aspects of the project.

**Documentation:**
As highlighted in the Goals segment, we recognized the significance of documentation and aimed to produce quality work. However, we miscalculated the time required, leading us to cram a significant amount of work late into the night. While we were aware of the importance of proper documentation, our improvement would involve not underestimating the effort needed and starting the documentation process much earlier. Additionally, we may have occasionally prioritized the wrong aspects of documentation, which could have been avoided through a comprehensive review before initiating the writing process. This issue ties back to a lack of proper management and organization between the two of us.

**User Roles:**
The addition of user roles, particularly the inclusion of a moderator function, is something we could implement with more time. Maintaining respectful conduct among all users in a chatroom is crucial. A moderator would have the authority to ban individuals engaging in inappropriate or disrespectful behavior, ensuring a more respectful and secure chatroom environment. While we considered incorporating this feature, time constraints prevented us from implementing it.

**Responsive Design:**
Improving the responsive design of the web application, especially when the user chooses to resize the window, is an area that could be enhanced. Although we made partial improvements, particularly on certain pages, the responsive design in chatrooms could be refined. While this issue doesn't affect the functionality of the web app, it can influence the overall user experience.
