## [Git Commit History]
This is a clarification. 
Both of us used Yakubs account to Commit changes in the Git Repository because Luka did not use his Account and it was easier for the both of us to share the account and work through one. That changend in the beginning of February because Luka for another course (Android App) needed to soon start working with his own account so he decided that it was not useful to just continue using Yakubs account. Luka account became a collabortar only in February until then the Commits from Yakubs account were both done by Luka and Yakub. At the end, Luka encountered a strange and overly challenging issue with the virtual environment, specifically the env1 folder. Because of this, he decided not to commit anymore to avoid committing any errors to the repository.
