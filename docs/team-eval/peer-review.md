### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

I believe that the design of the website is very well-executed. There has been a lot of thought put into small details. I appreciate the interactive feature on the Log In/Sign In page where the buttons light up upon hovering with the mouse. However, concerning the Log In and Sign In process, it would have been more user-friendly if clicking "Sign In" directly led to the main page instead of having to repeat the process with Log In. I also enjoy the animated features throughout the page, including the background and moving elements within the text. The Chatroom Creation feature is a positive aspect. While I may not be well-versed in anime, the changing pictures on the side in the Chatrooms could be slightly distracting.
### Effect on me (Wirkung)

[What positive or negative effect did this observation have on the reviewer?]
I am genuinely impressed with the website's design; it stands out as the strongest feature. It is evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into making the website visually appealing. However, I found the Chatrooms somewhat distracting. The Sign In and Login features were not optimal, as they require remembering the username for subsequent sign-ins.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

[What should be changed or strengthened for the point of view of the reviewer? ]
I recommend simplifying and making the Chatrooms less distracting. Additionally, consider enhancing the Sign In option to directly lead users to the main page upon clicking.
