## [Taha Omrane] - review 1

Translated from German into English

### My observation 

I believe that the design of the website is very well-executed. There has been a lot of thought put into small details. I appreciate the interactive feature on the Log In/Sign In page where the buttons light up upon hovering with the mouse. However, concerning the Log In and Sign In process, it would have been more user-friendly if clicking "Sign In" directly led to the main page instead of having to repeat the process with Log In. I also enjoy the animated features throughout the page, including the background and moving elements within the text. The Chatroom Creation feature is a positive aspect. While I may not be well-versed in anime, the changing pictures on the side in the Chatrooms could be slightly distracting.


### Effect on me 

[What positive or negative effect did this observation have on the reviewer?]
I am genuinely impressed with the website's design; it stands out as the strongest feature. It is evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into making the website visually appealing. However, I found the Chatrooms somewhat distracting. The Sign In and Login features were not optimal, as they require remembering the username for subsequent sign-ins.


### Tip for the future 

[What should be changed or strengthened for the point of view of the reviewer? ]
I recommend simplifying and making the Chatrooms less distracting. Additionally, consider enhancing the Sign In option to directly lead users to the main page upon clicking.

### My observation 

I believe you have a good website. The simple design makes it comprehensible, and the contrast of the bright background and the white chatrooms is effective. The colors you use align well with the theme of the site. I appreciate the interactive element when hovering over buttons or chatrooms. However, when attempting to click on "All About Anime" or "Contact Us," I found it a bit confusing because it was unclear at the top what had been clicked, and the content on the pages is similar. I find the chatroom creation feature to be excellent, as it is very user-friendly, but sometimes the images don't fit the frame of the chatroom.

### Effect on Me:
The page looks well-crafted. Personally, I'm not a fan of the extremely bright colors everywhere, but I think it suits the anime theme well since anime is known for being flashy and bright. Aside from the issue with "All About Anime" and "Contact Us," everything else was very well designed. The overall page design is impressive.

### Tip for the Future:
Consider delving deeper into the details to enhance the user journey. It's already good but has the potential to be even better. Additionally, I recommend addressing the issue with the images.
