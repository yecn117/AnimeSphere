## [The problem]

## [Our solution]

## [Target user]
The Target users are based on the Problems that it can solve for the people using the AnimeSphere. We have Personas of People who would use the AnimeSphere.

Persona 1:
- Name: Florian
- Age: 22
- Gender: Mann
- Marital Status: Single
- Occupation: Student

Biography: As a child, he enjoyed watching cartoons and anime after school. It was his way to unwind and escape from everything else. Since anime was considered corny during his childhood, he couldn't talk to anyone about his passion. Now that he is an adult, his passion for anime has not diminished at all. However, the stigma around anime has faded, and more people than ever are watching anime. His desire to talk to people about the medium he loves has continued to grow. 

Personality: Florian is an introverted individual with friends and a socially active lifestyle. However, due to his introverted nature, he tends to lose energy quickly in social settings, leading him to yearn for solitude to recharge, often within the comfort of his own four walls. Florian is a fun-loving person who enjoys and hopes for social interaction but feels uncomfortable with face-to-face encounters. As a result, most of his interactions happen online, where that discomfort isn't a factor, allowing him to express his fun-loving self. He is always up for a joke but can also take things seriously when necessary.
Florian sees himself as an intelligent person, sometimes to his own detriment. With a somewhat snobbish attitude towards anime, given his long-standing avid interest, he tends to consider his taste superior and is more than ready to defend that claim. Despite this, Florian is open to discussions and is always prepared for engaging conversations.

Interests: When Florian is not busy studying for his degree, he likes to spend his free time playing video games or at the gym. To unwind from the stresses of the day, Florian enjoys watching the latest episodes of his favorite anime or reading the newest chapter of the manga. After watching a new episode, Florian feels a strong desire to discuss what he has seen with like-minded individuals. It is only human to want to share his experinces, especially when he is that passionate about it. This is where AnimeSphere comes to the rescue. He can simply enter the room of the manga/anime he currently wants to discuss and start chatting. 

Persona 2:
- Name: Katia
- Age: 24
- Gender: Female
- Relationship Status: In a relationship
- Occupation: Office Clerk

Biography: Katia had never really watched anime and never had an interest in doing so. However, over the past few years, she stumbled across clips of anime on social media and heard friends rave about the latest anime hits. At work, she talks with a lot of people who enjoy watching and discussing anime. She listens to them talk back and forth about it, and what she hears sparks an interest in her. After some time, she finally decides to give her first anime a chance, and it does not disappoint. She enjoys it very much and wants to see more of it. As she delves deeper into anime, she realizes that she wants to talk about it. She begins discussing anime with her friends but soon realizes that they have not always seen what she has. So, she starts looking for different outlets to express her feelings on these anime. As a novice to anime and its community, she finds it challenging to do so. Social media platforms tend to lack a focus on her specific anime interests and can be overwhelming with information. That's when AnimeSphere comes in to help guide her introduction into the anime community and provide her with a chatroom dedicated to her favorite anime. Here, she can share her love and experience for the anime that she truly enjoys.

What the personas tell us about the target user of AnimeSphere is that they can be very different people in personality and walks of life. However, they share a striking similarity, and that is the love and passion for their favorite animes and the desire to talk about them. Depending on the person, conversations can range from simple sharing of experiences to complex analyses of the themes of these animes. But what stays true throughout is the desire for social interaction through the medium of anime.
The reason these users would choose AnimeSphere as their primary place to do this is that it eliminates the hassle and confusion of social media while still being simple and clear for all fans, from the seasoned veteran to the novice.
